{"name":"Raspberrypi <=> Arduino demo","body":"### Raspberry Pi <=> Arduino demo\r\nThis is a simple demo I wrote to introduce [ENSTA-Bretagne](www.ensta-bretagne.fr) robotics students to the [Raspberry Pi](www.raspberrypi.org) $35 computer.\r\n\r\nIt demonstrates the use of the [RXTX](http://rxtx.qbang.org) Java library to make the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino to talk to each other. The Arduino is connected to the Raspberry Pi via a USB cable.\r\nA servo is wired on the pin 9 of the Arduino, and you can control it from the Raspberry Pi via a simplistic graphical user interface.\r\n\r\nThe Netbeans Java project is located in the SerialArduino/ folder, the Arduino sketch is located in the arduino/ folder.\r\nYou will find a pre-built jar in the dist/ folder. It needs the rxtx library to be installed to work.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd RaspberryPi_SerialArduinoDemo/SerialArduino/dist/\r\n$ sudo apt-get install librxtx-java\r\n$ java -jar SerialArduinoDemo.jar\r\n```","tagline":"RaspberryPi and Arduino talking via a virtual serial port","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
